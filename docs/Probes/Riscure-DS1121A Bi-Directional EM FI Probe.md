The **Riscure-DS1121A** is a bidirectional fault injection probe designed for precise glitching applications in embedded security assessments. Notably This probe will allow you to do both Side-Channel ( #SCA) __as well as__ Fault-Injection ( #FI)

### Why This New Device? 
The first [[Riscure-DS1120A Uni-directional EM FI probe|Unidirectional Fault Injection Probe]] was created eight years ago. It induced fast, high-power EM pulses on a user-defined chip location so that the user could test the robustness of a chip or the effectiveness of countermeasures. The tested devices changed over time, so new features and improvements were necessary to get better, more efficient results. With this in mind, we created the Bidirectional Fault Injection Probe, which can glitch and measure simultaneously through the same tip at the same location.  

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Bidirectional Fault Injection**: Enables both positive and negative glitching for comprehensive testing.
